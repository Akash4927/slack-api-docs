# Slack API Docs

This is a copy of the files used to generate the Slack API documentation
at https://api.slack.com/. It can be followed to see changes in our API
documentation over time.

We appreciate bug reports and proposals for changes to our API docs,
but because this is a mirror of an internal slack repository we cannot
directly merge pull requests.

For help with the Slack API please [open a help request][help]. For updates
and questions follow [@SlackAPI on Twitter][twitter].
