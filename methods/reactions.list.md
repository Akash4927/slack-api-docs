Different item types can be reacted to. Every item in the list has a `type` property, the
other properties depend on the type of item. The possible types are:

 * **`message`**: the item will have a `message` property containing a [message object](/docs/messages) and a `channel` property containing the channel ID for the message.
 * **`file`**: this item will have a `file` property containing a [file object](/types/file).
 * **`file_comment`**: the item will have a `file` property containing the [file object](/types/file) and a `comment` property containing the file comment.

The users array in the `reactions` property might not always contain all users that have reacted (we limit it to X users, and X might change), however `count` will always represent the count of all
users who made that reaction (i.e. it may be greater than `users.length`). If the authenticated user has a given reaction then they are guaranteed to appear in the `users` array, regardless of
whether `count` is greater than `users.length` or not. If the complete list of users is required they can still be obtained by specifying the `full` argument.

The paging information contains the `count` of items returned, the `total`
number of items reacted to, the `page` of results returned in this response and
the total number of `pages` available.
