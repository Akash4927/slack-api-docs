This method takes an existing private group and performs the following steps:

 * Renames the existing group (from "example" to "example-archived").
 * Archives the existing group.
 * Creates a new group with the name of the existing group.
 * Adds all members of the existing group to the new group.

This is useful when inviting a new member to an existing group while hiding
all previous chat history from them. In this scenario you can call
`groups.createChild` followed by `groups.invite`.

The new group will have a special `parent_group` property pointing to the
original archived group. This will only be returned for members of both
groups, so will not be visible to any newly invited members.
