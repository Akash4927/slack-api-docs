## Profile 

The profile hash contains as much information as the user has supplied 
in the default profile fields: `first_name`, `last_name`, `real_name`, 
`email`, `skype`, and the `image_*` fields. Only the `image_*` fields are 
guaranteed to be included. Data that has not been supplied may not be 
present at all, may be null or may contain the empty string (""). Please 
note that custom profile fields are not yet available through the API.
