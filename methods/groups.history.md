This method returns a portion of messages/events from the specified private group.
To read the entire history for a group, call the method with no `latest` or
`oldest` arguments, and then continue paging using the instructions below.

## Response

	{
	    "ok": true,
	    "latest": "1358547726.000003",
	    "messages": [
	        {
	            "type": "message",
	            "ts": "1358546515.000008",
	            "user": "U2147483896",
	            "text": "Hello"
	        },
	        {
	            "type": "message",
	            "ts": "1358546515.000007",
	            "user": "U2147483896",
	            "text": "World",
	            "is_starred": true,
	        },
	        {
	            "type": "something_else",
	            "ts": "1358546515.000007",
	            "wibblr": true
	        }
	    ],
	    "has_more": false
	}

The `messages` array up to 100 messages between `latest` and `oldest`. If
there were more than 100 messages between those two points, then `has_more`
will be true.

If a message has the same timestamp as `latest` or `oldest` it will not be
included in the list. This allows a client to fetch all messages in a hole in
channel history, by calling groups.history with `latest` set to the oldest
message they have after the hole, and `oldest` to the latest message they have
before the hole. If the response includes `has_more` then the client can make
another call, using the `ts` value of the final messages as the `latest` param
to get the next page of messages.

If there are more than 100 messages between the two timestamps then the
messages returned are the ones closest to `latest`. In most cases an
application will want the most recent messages and will page backward from
there. If `oldest` is provided but not `latest` then the messages returned are
those closest to `oldest`, allowing you to page forward through history if
desired.

If the `latest` or `oldest` arguments are provided then those timestamps will
also be included in the output.

Messages of type `"message"` are user-entered text messages sent to the group, while other types
are events that happened within the group. All messages have both a `type` and a sortable
`ts`, but the other fields depend on the `type`. For a list of all possible events,
see the [channel messages](/docs/messages) documentation.

If a message has been starred by the calling user, the `is_starred` property will be present and
true. This property is only added for starred items, so is not present in the majority of messages.

The `is_limited` boolean property is only included for free teams that have
reached the free message limit. If true, there are messages before the current
result set, but they are beyond the message limit.
