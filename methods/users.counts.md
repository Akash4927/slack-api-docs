This method returns a list of all channels, groups and direct message channels open to the user. This
*does not* include public channels that the calling user is not a member of, but it does include
direct message channels which are currently not 'open' (but in which the caller is a participant).

Each channel/group/DM contains a count of unread messages, mentions and DMs. This can be used to quickly
show a summary of unread messages without fetching history for all channels.
