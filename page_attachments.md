# Attachments

It is possible to create more richly-formatted messages using Attachments.

Attachments can be added to messages in different ways:

* For [Incoming Webhooks](https://my.slack.com/services/new/incoming-webhook), send a regular payload, but include an `attachments` array, where each element is a hash containing an attachment.
* For [the API](/methods/chat.postMessage), include an `attachments` property, containing a JSON-encoded array of attachment hashes.
* For [Hammock](https://github.com/tinyspeck/hammock), pass an array of attachment hashes.


## Attachment structure

Messages can have zero or more attachments, defined as an array. Each hash in that array will contain multiple properties:

	{
		"fallback": "Required text summary of the attachment that is shown by clients that understand attachments
						but choose not to show them.",

		"text": "Optional text that should appear within the attachment",
		"pretext": "Optional text that should appear above the formatted data",

		"color": "#36a64f", // Can either be one of 'good', 'warning', 'danger', or any hex color code

		// Fields are displayed in a table on the message
		"fields": [
			{
				"title": "Required Field Title", // The title may not contain markup and will be escaped for you
				"value": "Text value of the field. May contain standard message markup and must be escaped as normal.
							May be multi-line.",
				"short": false // Optional flag indicating whether the `value` is short enough to be displayed side-by-side
							with other values
			}
		]
	}

For fields that support markup, the [Slack standard message markup](/docs/formatting) must be used.

Here is an example attachment generated from an incoming webhook:

## Automatic unfurling

Slack can also automatically create attachments based on the contents of URLs
in the message. Our [unfurling documentation](/docs/unfurling/) gives more
details on this functionality and how you can control it.

## Message Formatting

Slack messages may be formatted using a simple markup language similar to [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). **[Learn how to format messages.](/docs/formatting)**
