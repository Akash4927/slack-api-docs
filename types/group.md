    {

        "name": "secretplans",
        "is_group": "true",
        "created": 1360782804,
        "creator": "U024BE7LH",
        "is_archived": false,
        "members": [
            "U024BE7LH"
        ],
        "topic": {
            "value": "Secret plans on hold",
            "creator": "U024BE7LV",
            "last_set": 1369677212
        },
        "purpose": {
            "value": "Discuss secret plans that no-one else should know",
            "creator": "U024BE7LH",

    },

The `name` parameter indicates the name of the group.

`creator` is the user ID of the member that created this group. `created` is
a unix timestamp.

`is_archived` will be true if the group is archived.

`members` is a list of user ids for all users in this group. This
includes any disabled accounts that were in this group when they were
disabled.

`topic` and `purpose` provide information about the group topic and purpose.

Some API methods (such as [groups.create](/methods/groups.create)) will
include extra state information for the group. `is_open` shows if the group is
open. `last_read` is the timestamp for the last message the calling user has
read in this group. `unread_count` is a count of messages that the calling
user has yet to read. `latest` is the latest message in the group.
