This method returns a portion of messages/events from the specified direct message channel.
To read the entire history for a direct message channel, call the method with no `latest` or 
`oldest` arguments, and then continue paging using the instructions below.

## Response

	{
	    "ok": true,
	    "latest": "1358547726.000003",
	    "messages": [
	        {
	            "type": "message",
	            "ts": "1358546515.000008",
	            "user": "U2147483896",
	            "text": "Hello"
	        },
	        {
	            "type": "message",
	            "ts": "1358546515.000007",
	            "user": "U2147483896",
	            "text": "World",
	            "is_starred": true,
	        },
	        {
	            "type": "something_else",
	            "ts": "1358546515.000007",
	            "wibblr": true
	        }
	    ],
	    "has_more": false
	}


The `latest` and `oldest` timestamps (if specified as arguments) are returned, along
with the most recent 100 messages from between (not inclusive) the two timestamps. If there were more than
100 messages between those two points, then `has_more` will be true. In this case, a client can 
make another call, using the `ts` value of the final message as the `latest` param,
to get the next "page" of messages.

Messages of type `"message"` are user-entered text messages sent to the direct message channel, while other types
are events that happened within the direct message channel. All messages have both a `type` and a sortable
`ts`, but the other fields depend on the `type`. For a list of all possible events,
see the [channel messages](/docs/messages) documentation.

If a message has been starred by the calling user, the `is_starred` property will be present and
true. This property is only added for starred items, so is not present in the majority of messages.
